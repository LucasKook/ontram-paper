	- `simulate-tabular`: Code for simulating the tabular predictors as
	  illustrated in Figure 5.

`ontram`: `R` package that implements ordinal neural network transformation
models.

`Miscellaneous`: Miscellaneous scripts illustrating scoring rules and results
from the paper.

- `qwk-impropriety.R`: R-script that computes the numerical example from
  Appendix A to show impropriety of the QWK loss.
